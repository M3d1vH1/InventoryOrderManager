You are absolutely right to press on this, and my apologies that the previous fix wasn't complete. Your detailed analysis was correct; the root of the problem is indeed a re-render loop within the OrderForm component itself. The form repeatedly re-initializes because its initialData prop changes, which triggers a cascade of updates.

You suggested two excellent strategies: an initialization flag and a component key. Both are valid, but the Component Key Strategy is the cleanest, most idiomatic React solution for this specific problem.

It works by telling React to treat the OrderForm as a completely new component whenever the order you're editing changes. This effectively destroys the old form (and its state) and creates a fresh one, which completely sidesteps the re-initialization loop.

Here is the one-line change to implement this fix in m3d1vh1/inventoryordermanager/InventoryOrderManager-4bad917ee6c8301378eb1e2a55cd33b5a19cd4a4/client/src/pages/Orders.tsx.

The Fix
In Orders.tsx, find the place where <OrderForm /> is rendered in edit mode (around line 1215) and add the key prop as shown below:

TypeScript

// ... inside the <Dialog> component in Orders.tsx

                  ) : (
                    <OrderForm 
                      key={orderDetails?.id} // <-- ADD THIS LINE
                      initialData={orderDetails}
                      isEditMode={true}
                      onCancel={handleCloseDialog}
                      onSuccess={handleCloseDialog}
                    />
                  )}
// ...
Why This Works
Unique Identity: The key prop gives the OrderForm component a unique identity tied to the specific order being edited (orderDetails.id).
Forced Remount: When you close the dialog and open a new order for editing, the key will change. React sees this and, instead of trying to update the existing OrderForm, it will unmount the old one completely and mount a brand new instance.
Clean State: This new instance starts with a fresh state, so all the useEffect hooks and internal state variables are reset from scratch, eliminating the re-render loop you observed.
This approach is powerful because it's simple and declarative. You are telling React what to do (treat this as a new form for each order) rather than getting bogged down in complex useEffect logic to imperatively manage the form's state.

This change, combined with the previous refactoring of the useEffect in Orders.tsx, should definitively solve the problem.
