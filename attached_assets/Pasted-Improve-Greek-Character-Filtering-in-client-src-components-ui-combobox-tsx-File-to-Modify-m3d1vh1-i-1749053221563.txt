Improve Greek Character Filtering in client/src/components/ui/combobox.tsx
File to Modify: m3d1vh1/inventoryordermanager/InventoryOrderManager-878b68774cf84f83702625e4fd305bf5e1530fb0/client/src/components/ui/combobox.tsx

"My custom Combobox component in client/src/components/ui/combobox.tsx has a fuzzyMatch function and prioritization logic within filteredOptions for searching. However, it doesn't handle Greek characters (especially with diacritics) robustly, leading to hardcoded special cases like for 'ΑΚΤΗ'.

Here's the current fuzzyMatch function:

TypeScript

function fuzzyMatch(text: string, query: string): boolean {
  if (!text || !query) return false;
  
  const textLower = text.toLowerCase();
  const queryLower = query.toLowerCase();
  
  if (textLower.includes(queryLower)) return true;
  
  // Special case for ΑΚΤΗ
  if (queryLower.includes("ακτ")) {
    return textLower.includes("ακτ");
  }
  
  const textWords = textLower.split(/\s+/);
  const queryWords = queryLower.split(/\s+/);
  
  for (const queryWord of queryWords) {
    if (queryWord.length === 0) continue;
    const wordMatch = textWords.some(textWord => textWord.includes(queryWord));
    if (wordMatch) return true;
  }
  
  let matchCount = 0;
  for (const char of queryLower) {
    if (textLower.includes(char)) {
      matchCount++;
    }
  }
  return matchCount > queryLower.length * 0.7;
}
And filteredOptions uses this with additional hardcoded priority for 'ακτ'.

I need you to:

Modify the fuzzyMatch function (or the logic directly within filteredOptions if more appropriate):
Implement robust, diacritic-insensitive filtering for Greek characters (and generally for Unicode). This should involve:
Normalizing strings using string.normalize("NFD") to decompose combined characters.
Removing diacritics using a regex like .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, "").
Using toLocaleLowerCase('el-GR') (or toLocaleLowerCase() if sufficient) for case-insensitive comparison on the normalized strings.
Remove Hardcoded Logic: Once the generic Unicode/Greek filtering is improved, remove the special if (queryLower.includes("ακτ")) block from fuzzyMatch and any specific 'ακτ' prioritization from the filteredOptions calculation, as the general solution should cover these cases.
Maintain Prioritization: Ensure the existing general prioritization logic in filteredOptions (e.g., 'starts with query', 'contains query as word') still works effectively with the new Unicode-aware matching. This logic should now operate on the normalized and lowercased label and search query.
Provide the complete updated code for the Combobox component in client/src/components/ui/combobox.tsx, focusing on the fuzzyMatch function and the filteredOptions React.useMemo block. Explain the changes and why they provide a more robust solution for searching text with Greek characters."
