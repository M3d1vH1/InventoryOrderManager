# Deployment Instructions

## Issue with Deployment Process

The deployment process is failing because the build process is taking too long in the Replit environment. The large number of dependencies (especially Lucide React icons) causes the build to time out.

## Suggested Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy in Development Mode (Temporary)

The deployment will work if you use `npm run dev` as the run command. While this isn't ideal for production, it will get the application deployed until a proper optimized build can be configured.

### Option 2: Optimize the Build Process

For a proper production deployment:

1. Modify the `.replit` deployment configuration:
   - Change the deployment run command from `npm run dev` to `npm run start`
   - This requires first building the application successfully
   
2. Optimize the build process:
   - Consider tree-shaking unused Lucide icons
   - Split the build into smaller chunks
   - Increase memory limits for the build process

### Next Steps

1. For now, deploy using the development mode
2. In the future, we can optimize the build process to allow for proper production deployments
