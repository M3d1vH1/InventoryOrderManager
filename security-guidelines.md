# Warehouse Management System - Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Warehouse Management System as well as recommendations for secure hosting.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Network Security
- âœ… HTTPS Enforcement: The application enforces HTTPS in production environments
- âœ… HSTS Headers: HTTP Strict Transport Security implemented with 180-day duration
- âœ… Secure CORS Policy: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing restricted to configured domains

### 2. API Security
- âœ… Rate Limiting: Protection against abuse with 100 requests per 15-minute window
- âœ… Login Brute Force Protection: Strict limits with 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes
- âœ… Input Validation: All input validated using Zod schemas
- âœ… SQL Injection Protection: Using parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM

### 3. Authentication & Session Security
- âœ… Secure Cookie Settings: 
  - HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript access
  - Secure: SSL-only in production
  - SameSite: Strict CSRF protection
  - Path Restriction: Limited to base path
- âœ… Random Session Secret: Secure random session secret in production
- âœ… Strong Password Hashing: Bcrypt with sufficient work factor
- âœ… Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): User roles with permissions system

### 4. Content Security
- âœ… Helmet.js Protection: 
  - Content-Security-Policy (CSP) configured
  - XSS Protection
  - No-Sniff
  - Hide Powered-By
- âœ… File Upload Restrictions:
  - Size limits (5MB)
  - Safe filenames
  - Extension preservation

### 5. Error Handling & Logging
- âœ… Secure Error Responses: Limited information in production
- âœ… Structured Error Logging: Non-sensitive errors logged for troubleshooting

## Additional Recommendations for Production Hosting

### 1. Infrastructure Security
- ðŸ”² Configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
- ðŸ”² Set up DDoS protection services
- ðŸ”² Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to handle TLS termination
- ðŸ”² Keep all server OS packages updated

### 2. Database Security
- ðŸ”² Implement regular database backups with encryption
- ðŸ”² Restrict database access via network security groups/firewall
- ðŸ”² Enable PostgreSQL connection SSL/TLS
- ðŸ”² Implement database connection pooling for efficiency
- ðŸ”² Set up database query monitoring and logging

### 3. Monitoring & Alerting
- ðŸ”² Implement application performance monitoring (APM)
- ðŸ”² Set up real-time security alerting
- ðŸ”² Configure health check endpoints and monitoring
- ðŸ”² Establish error rate thresholds and alerts

### 4. Environment Management
- ðŸ”² Set NODE_ENV=production to enable production safeguards
- ðŸ”² Use a secrets management system for API keys and credentials
- ðŸ”² Rotate all credentials regularly (database passwords, API keys)
- ðŸ”² Never commit sensitive information to version control
- ðŸ”² Keep a separate .env file for production environment variables

### 5. Audit & Compliance
- ðŸ”² Regularly audit user access and permissions
- ðŸ”² Implement periodic security reviews and vulnerability scanning
- ðŸ”² Create a security incident response plan
- ðŸ”² Document compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## Environment Variables for Security

For production deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:

```
# Base URL of the application for CORS and redirects
APP_URL=https://your-production-domain.com

# Enable production mode
NODE_ENV=production 

# Random session secret (generate a unique value)
SESSION_SECRET=generate_a_long_random_string

# Database connection string with SSL mode
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
```

## Security Contacts

For security issues, contact:
- Your Administrator: [admin@example.com]

## Security Updates

This application uses npm packages that should be regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
Run `npm audit` and `npm update` regularly to maintain security.
